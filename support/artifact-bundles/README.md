# Support tools



This artifact bundle contains artifacts to verify Image Streamer installation and configuration by doing a simple deployment using UEFI grub image.
The UEFI grub image available in CentOS 6.7 distribution is used without any modification as a golden image in this artifact bundle. 



The planscripts in this artifact bundle inject text strings into /EFI/BOOT/message.txt to demonstrate that ImageStreamer is able to personalize the image. Upon booting the server with this image, the contents of the message.txt will be displayed on the console proving that server is able to boot the personalized image.

Name : grub

Version : 0.97

Summary : Grand Unified Boot Loader.

Description : GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader) is an experimental boot loader capable of booting into most free operating systems - Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, GNU Mach, and others as well as most commercial operating systems.
